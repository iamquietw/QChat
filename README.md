# QChat by iamquietw (_iqw)

New Spigot chat plugin.
It has two chats by default (LOCAL and GLOBAL) and can be used as a Library for other plugins that need to create new chat.

Usage:
 - /chat global (to write messages only in global chat)
 - /chat local (to write messages in local chat or in global chat with "!" as the first char of the message)
 - /chat <chatName) (for other plugins, for example /chat party)
 - Alias for /chat - /c
 - No permissions required.
